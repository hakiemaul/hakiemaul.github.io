    <h1>What to do with your spare time?</h1>
    <p>Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities
      that develop the mind, such as reading and doing crossword puzzles. Others
      feel that it is important to give one’s mind a rest in leisure time.</p>

      <p>As we are human we naturally need to rest on leisure time to recover the
      stress of work and everyday life. In fact, every individual need to do what
      they want and belong to them. Personally, I prefer to be active during this
      time because it is feel right to me better. Moreover, people are free for
      what they do on their leisure time, and nobody can say what it is the best.</p>

      <p>Some people want to relax after their day of work. These people may prefer
      to relax by watching movies, reading or getting a massage. People who have
      a physically jobs such as doctors, teachers and builders may choose these
      types of activities. If you are a doctor, you may feel that you want to let
      your body rest after work and you don’t want to do a five kilometer run
      after work, because you are already physically tired.

            <h2>1. Take a walk.</h2>
            <p>This is a form of exercise that doesn’t take long, and you
              can do it anywhere — but even more important, it’s a good way
              to stretch your legs from sitting at your desk too long, and
              it gets your creative juices flowing. If you’re ever stuck
              for ideas, taking a walk is a good way to get unstuck.</p>

            <h2>2. Don't forget to read.</h2>
            <p>Reading is a lifelong skill, and successful people never stop
              reading new books. Whether it's fiction or nonfiction, books
              help give you a greater understanding of the world around
              you. They introduce you to new characters, new environments,
              new cultures, new philosophies, and new ideas, and might even
              help you build new skills (if you're reading nonfiction,
              at least).</p>

            <h2>3. Start learning.</h2>
            <p>Education shouldn't stop at college and restricted to a
            formal institution. The most succesful people take their own
            commitment to never stop learning. They're always incorporating
            of their new skills for their resumes and constantly learning
            from their surrounding. Informal learning can be found anywhere
            in this globalised world. You can always find free courses all
            over the web</p>

            <h2>4. Take up a hobby.</h2>
            <p>Some people put all their focus and effort into work.
            While work is important, one shouldn't downplay the effect
            of stress in our life. Finding and pursuing a hobby can help
            you relieve stress, put your job in perspective, and build skills
            that complement ones you use at work. It's a breath of fresh air
            that keeps you grounded.</p>

            <h2>5. Spend time with your loved ones.</h2>
            <p>We often don't realize that our job isn't everything. Focusing
            too much on your career is self-sabotage. If you want to be succesful
            in life, you must balance your work life with your personal life,
            and don't forget to prioritize your personal relationships. No matter
            how much you want to be succesful and climb the corporate ladder, you
            simply can't neglect your friends and families while doing so. </p>
